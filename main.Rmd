This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
##setting directory
setwd("C:/Viral/Courses/INFM 600/Information Discovery/2016_presidential_election")
getwd()

##reading datasets
countyfacts = read.csv("county_facts.csv",na.strings = c("NA","","NULL"))
results = read.csv("primary_results.csv")
countyfacts$state_abbreviation = factor(countyfacts$state_abbreviation)
results$county=paste(results$county,"County")

##calculating the population of educated people of each county
countyfacts$educatedpeople = countyfacts$PST045214*countyfacts$EDU635213

##subsetting the states to only include Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina
fourstates = subset(countyfacts, state_abbreviation %in% c("IA","NH","NV","SC"))

##calculating the total votes per county
votecount=aggregate(votes ~ county, FUN=sum,data=results)
colnames(votecount) <- c("area_name","votes")

##merging fourstates and votecount dataframe
combineresult=merge(x=fourstates,y=votecount)

## descriptive statistics of both variables
summary(combineresult$votes)
summary(combineresult$educatedpeople)

##Correlation test and writing the file to the system
cor.test(combineresult$educatedpeople,combineresult$votes)
write.csv(combineresult,"combineresult.csv")

##plotting the correlation
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(combineresult,aes(educatedpeople,votes))+geom_point()+labs(x="Number of Educated People",y="Total number of votes")

##plotting the correlation statewise
p <- ggplot(combineresult,aes(educatedpeople,votes))+geom_point()+labs(x="Number of Educated People",y="Total number of votes")
p+facet_grid(state_abbreviation ~ .)

```
